# Anomaly-Detection-in-Pressure-Hydrogen-Networks
This repository contains the experiments of my Industrial Ph.D. project in Computational Intelligence at unina and ENEA. It involves applying anomaly detection techniques to multivariate time series from a set of hydrogen pressure detection sensors within the hydrogen transport network. In this scenario, compressor failures, valve closures, local restrictions, etc., can occur. The dataset was generated by simulating the system in Simscape, in which I created a dataset containing the system's normality description and three other datasets in which we introduced anomalies by simulating component failures and local restrictions, representing a real scenario.
